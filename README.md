# *  Description of the program
# *******************************************************

# The program features a Rectangle class, a Point class,
# and a main.cpp driver. It creates two rectangles based
# on user input, prints out their coordinates starting
# from the top-left and goes counter-clockwise. The Point
# class specifies the schematic for a coordinate

# Name:  main.cpp
#    Main program.  This is the driver program that contains
#    all of the logic for the program. 

# Name: Point.h
#    The header file for the Point class 

# Name: Point.cpp
#    The file that contains all of the logic for the Pointer class.

#    and specifies how they should be printed to the screen

# Name: Rectangle.h
#    The header file for the Rectangle class

# Name: Rectangle.cpp
#    The file that contains all of the logic for the Rectangle class.
#    Includes getters for the height, width, and top left coordinate,
#    a printCoordinates function, and a function that determines 
#    whether or not to Rectangles intersect
